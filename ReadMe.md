# Description
Introductory assignment for graduate machine learning course. 

The dataset is explored using statistics like median and standard deviation. Given 6 pre-trained classification models, the models are evaluated based on metrics like confusion matrices, precision, recall, FDR, and MCC. The metrics are self-defined, as an exercise, and are not calculated using built-in libraries.
